- Not showing anything
 -> Possible minimized scale due to inches. Check Configure -> Unit Setup -> System Unit Setup
- Cannot export .visual
 -> Go to Customize -> Config System Paths -> 3rd Party Plugin -> add the /bigworld/tools/exporter/version from BigWorld 2.1
- Not valid material link: (absolule link to .png making export failure)
 -> Rendering -> Material Explorer -> Photometric/Bitmap Path -> Strip All Paths 
- Crash upon F5/Entering with no log
 Possible missing hardpoint (HP). Check HP_gunJoint in turret, etc.
 
- Monotone or blank camo on turret/hull/etc.
Issue caused by texture larger than camo appliance size (aoTextureSize field); resize it to correct level. 
 
- Editing UV mapping using .ms script: 
After scaling, resize corresponding dds (AM, AMM, AO, GMM) to the ratio you want. E.g if you resized to 4x4, every images should be topleft 1x1 of the new images' 4x4

- Weird shade?
Currently fixed by removing normal map. See below for possible fix

Face normal invertion: 
- Select gun object -> Editable Mesh, Yes -> use Selction, Face -> Ctrl+A to select all -> Surface Properties, Flip
- Select gun object -> Modifier List, Normal -> uncheck Flip Normal -> Collapse To
Vertex normal invertion:
Tools -> Mirror; then Modifier -> Mirror

- Animate antenna:
 + Create two bones @ root and tip (Create -> System -> Bones IK chain). Can create multiple bones, but should only assign those two to the mesh
 + Select all antenna vertices; Modifier List -> Skin. Add the two bones to the mesh.
 + While still selecting all vertices, select Edit Envelope (or expandable Skin->Envelop)
 + Adjust the root bone so the outer envelope cover the whole antenna; long-press falloff (third button in Envelope Properties) and select quick falloff
 + Adjust the tip bone, also use the outer envelope on the whole antenna, long-press falloff and either use linear or quick falloff. Quick is more conservative; Linear introduce some sort of "bounce" on the lower section.
 + NOTE: Make sure to change the fx to the skinned version when copying material from original

- Pivoting tilted 3D objects (for miniturrets, autorotors, etc.).
 + Create a Working pivot, and align it manually until you can turn the objects using that pivot
 + Go into Edit Working Pivot and turn on MAXScript Listener
 + Retrieve orientation and location of it (the currently selected Working Pivot) using `quatToEuler2 $.transform.rotation` and `$.pos`
 + Select the object, set to Affect Pivot only, and copy these params down on the object Pivot

 
Making SWF GUI:
Compile the python binding with compileall
C:\Python27\python.exe -m compileall py\mod_UML_interface.py

Compile the swf, with its external swc(s) are found in gui-part1/2.pkg; stand in `root` folder (you should see the `as3` folder)
D:\Archive\flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B\bin\mxmlc  -compiler.source-path=as3 -compiler.external-library-path+=as3\lib\common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc,as3\lib\gui_base-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -o as3\UML_MainGUI.swf as3\uml\UML_MainGUI.as
D:\Archive\flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B\bin\mxmlc.bat  -compiler.source-path=as3 -compiler.external-library-path+=as3\lib\common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc,as3\lib\gui_base-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -o as3\UML_MainGUI.swf as3\uml\UML_MainGUI.as
If installed in Windows 64bit, consider using the mxmlc.bat trick if encountering "Could not find JVM". Content of it should be:
"""
@echo off
for  %%i in (%0) do set FLEX_HOME=%%~dpi..
java -jar "%FLEX_HOME%\lib\mxmlc.jar" +flexlib="%FLEX_HOME%/frameworks" %*
"""

Those swc can also be viewed using JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler

Forced customization:
C:\Python27\python.exe -m compileall py\mod_replaceOwnCustomization.py
D:\Archive\flex_sdk_4.6.0.23201B\bin\mxmlc  -compiler.source-path=as3 -compiler.external-library-path+=as3\lib\common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc,as3\lib\gui_base-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -o as3\ROC_GUI.swf as3\uml\ReplaceOwnCustomizationGUI.as
Additionally, to pack into independent .wotmod (not updated)
py pyc_to_wotmod.py py\mod_replaceOwnCustomization.py as3\ROC_GUI.swf ReplaceOwnCustomization.wotmod

Binding between swf and python classes are achieved with:
g_entitiesFactories.addSettings(ViewSettings("UML_MainGUI", UML_MainGUI, 'UML_MainGUI.swf',
						WindowLayer.WINDOW, None, ScopeTemplates.GLOBAL_SCOPE, isModal=True, canClose=True, canDrag=False))

Currently only swf can call python function; creating GUI objects must use App.utils.classFactory.getClass. NOTE: can use getClassName instead of searching for this crap
DropdownMenu -> DropdownMenuUI
SoundButtonEx -> ButtonNormal

Use ScrollingListPx instead of ScrollingListEx;

The game reload the swf after battle; so you can replace and test things quick on the flash front; simply replace the file, play a battle, and the changes will be updated.

Own music module:
C:\Python27\python.exe -m compileall py\mod_replaceOwnMusic.py

The current governing music module is MusicControllerWWISE's MusicController, which create a dictionary of what music to play during event.
__soundEvents should hold the majority of cached sounds; __overriddenEvents SHOULD be overboard those, but the code doesn't reflect that.
Once we can leverage SoundGroups's MP3 function, we should be done for our 1st objective.

GIMP:
Edit separate channels by Color -> Components -> Decompose, choose RGBA, edit the other image as you please, then Recompose.
AO map:
- R is decal exclusion map. White will not receive decals.
- G is Ambient Occlusion, ie shadow from global illumination. White will receive propotionally less shadow than black
- B is mud exclusion map. White will not receive mud.
- A is camouflage exclusion map. Black will not receive camo.

GMM map:
- R is smooth/gloss map - white will be more reflective (white is glass-like)
- G is metallic map - white will be overlaid gray over other camo/paint map. Useful to add more scratch/wear details. Should be used in conjunction with R channel
- B is paint exclusion map. Black will not receive paint

How to do fading:
- Have unfaded
- Add Layer Mask, (recommend to do full transparency)
- Noise -> Plasma, change seed + turbulence until the regions look fine
- Color -> Curve, reorganize as wanted
- If want to copy one mask to another, do Layer to Selection, then Add Layer Mask with "Selection" option

How to extract camo/paint mask from single-colored texture (diffuse):
- Color to Alpha, select the color so it's gone
- Color -> Components -> Extract Component -> Alpha
- Invert the value (so the white is paint overlaid over the colored texture)
- Rescale coloring range if needed

Interesting tools:
- Color -> Components -> Mono Mixer, Useful to create new coloring from old if the texture is single-colored.

How to copy paint mask to camo mask:
Need GMM (paint) and AO (camo); generate your own if needed.
Open both, Colors -> Decompose (remember this is RGBA) to get base layers; copy GMM Blue (and __resize__ if needed, most of the time) to AO Alpha; 
Once anchored, Recompose and Export using DTX5
Usually perform on HD will suffice if you don't intent to zoom too much, but it's best practice to do both. SD has mipmap, HD doesn't, so best to do them separately

Base density for models should be 1 1

V node is for building the chassis hull; we can separate the wheels/tracks node to another one and it will works fine.
V_BlendBone is the upper bone for track; the other one is the lower bone; adjust accordingly.
WD are for controlling the sprocket wheels; while W are for road wheels.
